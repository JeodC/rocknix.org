### Screen Calibration

The Powkiddy X55 screen is miscalibrated from the factory. While there's no universal fix (yet) this issue can greatly be mitigated by using a Retroarch Shader. Instructions for doing so are listed below:

1. Start a game
2. Open the "Quick Menu" in Retroarch by pressing both joysticks
3. Navigate to "Shaders"
4. Turn "Video Shader" to "ON"
5. Navigate to "Load Preset"
6. Select "Misc" -> "Image Adjustment"
7. Go to "Shader Parameters" and change the following parameters:
- Target Gamma -> 2.40
- Monitor Gamma 2.00
- Saturation -> 1.50
- Contrast -> 1.15
- Black Level -> -0.10
8. Navigate back to the shader menu and pick "Save Preset"
9. Select Either:
- "Save Global Preset" to have this as the default for all Retroarch cores
- "Save Core Preset" to have this as the default for a specific system (e.g all PSX games)
- "Save Content Preset" to have this as the default for a specific directory (e.g all roms in a "RPG" directory)
- "Save Game Preset" to have this as the default for the specific game that you're running

The settings at 7 are just a proposal, you might want to experiment a bit to get something that matches your preferences but they should serve as a great starting point.

As a bonus, adjust the "Horizontal Overscan %" and "Vertical Overscan %" settings to deal with e.g PSX games that have black borders (such as Crash Tag Team Racing and Spyro).

The black bars on the sides when displaying 4:3 content will not be effected by shaders and might thus look lighter than the game image. If you find this distracting a (lighter) overlay will hide this issue.
